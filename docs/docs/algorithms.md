### Fair algorithms

Previous algorithms can be separated into two groups:

- First group: incorporate certain quantitative fairness policy into existing machine learning algorithms. But such methods typically deal with specific families of classifiers, such as SVMs.
- Second group: eliminate the restriction to specific classifier families and treat the underlying classification method as a "black box". Such methods usually implements a wrapper works by pre-processing on the data set or post-processing on the prediction results.
